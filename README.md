## üçúPh·ªü Maker, a taste of homeüçú

## Backstory (how I brainstormed the webapp)
So, what's this all about?
Honestly, this whole thing started because I was homesick.

There's nothing that reminds me of home more than a good bowl of Ph·ªü. It's not just the taste. it's the whole ritual: the smell of the broth simmering for hours, the clatter of the bowls, the piles of fresh herbs. The background, the little plastic stools, the patterns on the bowls, etc. every little detail in this game is a memory from the streets I grew up on.

I wanted to see if I could capture a little piece of that feeling and turn it into something fun. This game is my love letter to Ph·ªü and a little slice of my home that I built with code. All the art is hand-drawn by me in Procreate, trying to capture that cozy, perfectly imperfect vibe.

It's a simple game, built with a lot of love, a little bit of code, and a whole lot of nostalgia‚ù§Ô∏è

## Gameplay & features
Ph·ªü Maker is a series of fun minigames that walk you through the authentic process of making a bowl of Ph·ªü from scratch.

### Stage 1: The market run (Ingredient gathering)

Objective: Find all the correct ingredients for the broth.

Gameplay: Click on the correct items from a collection of fresh (and distracting!) ingredients laid out on wooden shelves, just like at the local market.

Visuals: Features all ingredients, a custom wooden shelf background, and a notepad recipe list that checks off items as you find them.

### Stage 2: The broth (Cooking)

Charring: A timed mini-game where you have to stop the charring process at the perfect moment.

Skimming: A classic "whack-a-mole" style game where you click to skim the scum off the top of your simmering broth.

Simmering: Click to add your beautifully charred aromatics, bones, and spices to your custom-drawn stockpot.

### Stage 3: The final assembly

Objective: Build the perfect bowl, step-by-step.

Gameplay: Click on the final ingredients (noodles, beef, broth, herbs) in the correct order.

Visuals: With each click, the main bowl image updates to show the new ingredient being added, culminating in a picture-perfect, steaming bowl of Ph·ªü.

### Other cool stuff:

100% custom art: Every visual, from the background to the buttons to the cursors, was hand-drawn using Procreate, and the whole looking of the web is brought to life using Figma.

Animated UI: The instruction text types itself out with a blinking cursor.

Scoring system: You get points for correct choices and lose them for mistakes, with a final star rating at the end.
